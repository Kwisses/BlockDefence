## Game Mechanics ##

Summary: The goal of the game is to complete all 10 levels without dieing. 

### How To Play ##

The player buys block towers which have specific range and damage parameters. There are four types of blocks: green blue, yellow, and purple.

The player can only place their towers on the red portions of the map (the white portions are reserved for the enemies).

Once the player clicks the "Start" button, the enemies will start to spawn from the top-right portion of the map. They will move around the map moving towards the bottom-left portion of the map.

If an enemy gets to their target, you will lose a life and they will despawn. If you run out of lives, you lose!
